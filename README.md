## 🔬 About Me

🎓 BSAI Student at **Islamia College University Peshawar**  
🏢 Research Assistant at **Digital Image Processing (DIP) Lab**  
📍 Peshawar, Pakistan  

I am passionate about building intelligent systems in:

- Computer Vision  
- Deep Learning  
- Medical AI  
- NLP Research  

---

## 🧪 Research Interests
- Explainable AI (XAI) for Psychological Applications  
- Computer Vision for Emotion & Behavior Recognition  
- Deep Learning in Mental Health Support Systems  
- Facial Expression & Social Interaction Analysis  
- Trustworthy and Human-Centered AI

## 🧠 Research Focus: XAI in Psychological AI

I am deeply interested in applying **Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)**  
to psychological and human-centered problems, such as:

- Emotion & Mood Detection  
- Personality-Aware AI Systems  
- Mental Health & Behavioral Prediction  
- Trustworthy AI for Social Applications  

My goal is not only to build accurate models, but also to understand:

✅ *Why the model makes a decision*  
✅ *Which facial or behavioral cues influence predictions*  
✅ *How AI can support psychological research ethically*
