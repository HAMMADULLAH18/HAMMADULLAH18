## 🔬 About Me

🎓 Bachelor of Science in Artificial Intelligence (BSAI) Student  
🏫 Islamia College University Peshawar  
🏢 Research Assistant at **Digital Image Processing (DIP) Lab**  
📍 Peshawar, Pakistan  

I am passionate about building intelligent systems that combine:

- Deep Learning  
- Computer Vision  
- NLP  
- Human-Centered AI

## 🧠 Research Focus: XAI in Emotion & Mental Health

My main research interest is applying **Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)**  
to psychological and mental health-related problems.

I aim to develop AI systems that can:

- Detect emotions and mood states  
- Support mental health understanding  
- Provide trustworthy explanations behind predictions  

✨ My mission is not only to build accurate models, but also to answer:

✅ *Why did the model predict stress or sadness?*  
✅ *Which facial or behavioral cues influenced the decision?*  
✅ *How can AI become transparent and ethical in healthcare?*
